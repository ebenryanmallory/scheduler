▶ Elevator Pitch & Vision Statement • Clearly articulate the groundbreaking nature of your modular assistive devices: emphasize how your technology goes beyond the status quo.
• Highlight the synergy between AI/ML and robotics and how this can translate into real-world solutions.
• Stress that you’re not merely improving existing devices, but pushing boundaries to create lighter, more adaptable, and personalized solutions.
▶ Research-First Approach
• Explicitly explain that your startup’s immediate focus is on research and proof-of-concept MVPs, not on near-term commercialization.

• Emphasize that financial backers will essentially fund philanthropic R&D that can improve lives, garner potential PR, and accelerate the entire field.

▶ Donation Page

• Transparency mechanism - highlight where funds will go: prototyping, materials, lab costs, or groundbreaking experiments.

▶ Testimonials & Use Case Demo

▶ Leverage Academic/Research Credibility
• Publish or share your R&D findings on preprint servers or relevant robotics/healthcare journals if possible.

• Present at specialized workshops or meetups to build credibility among peer researchers who may connect you with potential donors or institutions.

▶ Partnerships
• Collaborate with existing companies or nonprofits in assistive technology who themselves have philanthropic arms.

• Seek endorsements or letters of support from healthcare professionals or well-known robotics experts—these can be added to websites and pitch decks.

▶ Offer “Behind the Scenes” Access
• Invite potential donors to virtual or live demos of the devices under development.

• Show your lab environment, your testing methods, and prototypes in action—this fosters trust and excitement.

▶ Highlight PR Value
• Outline how an organization can benefit from positive media attention for supporting your R&D.

• Emphasize that you’re working in a space that has a clear social-impact story.

▶ Update Donors & Community Regularly
• Share quarterly or monthly updates on progress, new breakthroughs, and next research steps.

• Build a sense of community among donors so they feel part of the journey.

▶ Consider Crowdfunding
• If direct donations from large donors are slow to come, a well-organized crowdfunding campaign can tap into a broader base of supporters interested in assistive tech.

• Use video content and real user stories to make the campaign approachable and humane.
