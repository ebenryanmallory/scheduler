In light of less than stellar performance metrics, combined with worse forward looking expectations, the decision was made with guidance to wind down the project. The pivot will be more of a soft transition, and other product or projects will leverage the technology. A minimal amount of time will be devoted to maintenance, and only critical features or updates will be implemented. Moving forward this time allocation will be for SparkGPU.
