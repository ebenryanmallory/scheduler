## Netflix & Nietzsche: Show-to-Text Pairings

### 1. **Succession → Machiavelli's *The Prince***
**Connection:** The Roy family's brutal power dynamics are a masterclass in Machiavellian strategy. Every episode features characters wrestling with whether it's better to be feared or loved, how to maintain power through strategic cruelty, and the art of political manipulation. Logan Roy is essentially a modern prince ruling a media empire instead of a city-state.
**Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Perfect match - the writers clearly studied Machiavelli)

### 2. **The Good Place → Multiple Philosophy Texts** 
**Connection:** The show literally teaches moral philosophy through comedy, featuring actual discussions of Aristotle's virtue ethics, Kant's categorical imperative, and utilitarian calculations. Characters grapple with what makes actions good or bad while navigating the afterlife.
**Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Explicit philosophy content baked into the narrative)

### 3. **Squid Game → Rousseau's *Social Contract* & Marx's *Communist Manifesto***
**Connection:** The games are a hyperbolic representation of capitalism's inequalities and the dissolution of social contracts. Players literally sign away their rights, the wealthy watch the poor fight for entertainment, and cooperation vs. competition mirrors Rousseau's ideas about human nature and Marx's class struggle.
**Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Powerful allegory for economic inequality)

### 4. **Black Mirror → Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" & Baudrillard's *Simulacra and Simulation***
**Connection:** Episodes consistently explore the nature of reality, technology as the new cave wall casting shadows we mistake for truth. "San Junipero," "USS Callister," and "Bandersnatch" directly question what's real and what's simulation.
**Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Each episode is essentially a philosophical thought experiment)
