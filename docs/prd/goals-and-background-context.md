# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enhance the calendar-driven task organizer to support recurring tasks, time tracking, and intelligent scheduling
- Improve mobile responsiveness and offline capabilities for on-the-go productivity
- Implement smart notifications and focus mode to maximize deep work sessions
- Add analytics and insights to help users understand and optimize their productivity patterns
- Integrate with external calendars and health tracking systems for holistic time management
- Maintain the unique markdown-based storage with Git sync as a competitive advantage

## Background Context

The Scheduler App is a calendar-driven task organizer designed for founders managing multiple startups who need to maximize productivity through structured time blocking. The current MVP provides basic task management with time blocks, projects, and ideas, but lacks critical features for sustained productivity such as recurring tasks, time tracking, and mobile optimization.

This PRD outlines enhancements to transform the scheduler from a basic task organizer into a comprehensive productivity system. The improvements are organized into 5 phases over 12-16 weeks, prioritizing high-impact foundational features first. The app's unique selling point—markdown-based storage with Git sync—will be preserved and enhanced with better conflict resolution and multi-device support.
