# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The Scheduler App should provide a clean, distraction-free interface that helps users focus on their current task while maintaining awareness of their overall schedule. The design should feel modern and premium, with smooth animations and thoughtful micro-interactions. The interface should adapt seamlessly between desktop and mobile, with touch-friendly controls and gesture support on mobile devices.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Drag and Drop**: Primary method for rescheduling tasks between time blocks
- **Quick Add**: Keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + N) to add tasks from anywhere
- **Command Palette**: Cmd/K to access all features without leaving keyboard
- **Swipe Gestures**: Mobile-specific gestures for navigation and task actions
- **Focus Mode**: Full-screen immersive mode for deep work sessions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential information by default, reveal details on demand

## Core Screens and Views

1. **Main Dashboard** - Calendar view with time blocks and task list
2. **Task Detail Modal** - Full task editing with all fields and options
3. **Analytics Dashboard** - Charts and insights for productivity patterns
4. **Focus Mode** - Full-screen view with current task and timer
5. **Settings Page** - Preferences, integrations, and account settings
6. **Archive View** - Historical completed tasks with search and filter
7. **Projects View** - Project-level overview with milestones and progress
8. **Ideas Parking Lot** - Quick capture and organization of future ideas

## Accessibility

WCAG AA compliance required, including:
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Respect for reduced motion preferences
- Focus indicators for all interactive elements

## Branding

Modern, clean aesthetic with emphasis on productivity and focus:
- Primary color: Blue (#3B82F6) for trust and focus
- Accent colors: Green (#10B981) for success, Amber (#F59E0B) for warnings
- Typography: Inter for UI, Fira Code for monospace elements
- Smooth transitions and micro-animations for premium feel
- Dark mode as first-class citizen, not an afterthought

## Target Device and Platforms

Web Responsive (desktop and mobile browsers), with PWA installation support for iOS, Android, and desktop platforms. Mobile-optimized layouts with touch-friendly controls and gesture support.
