acceptance_criteria_review:
  ac1_auto_commit:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "gitSyncService.scheduleCommit() called in server/index.ts after task POST/PUT/DELETE. Commits staged with git.add('.') and committed with generated message."
  ac2_debounce:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "debounceMs = 30000 in gitSyncService.ts:49. setTimeout clears and resets on each scheduleCommit() call. Batch changes accumulated in pendingChanges array."
  ac3_auto_push:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "pushWithRetry() called after successful commit in performCommitAndPush(). Checks for remote before attempting push, gracefully handles no-remote scenario."
  ac4_sync_status_indicator:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "SyncStatusIndicator.tsx with 5 states: idle, syncing, synced, error, conflict. Each state has distinct icon, color, and label. SyncStatusBadge in header shows compact view."
  ac5_last_sync_timestamp:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "lastSyncTime stored in SyncState, updated after successful sync. getRelativeTime() in useGitSync.ts converts to human-readable format ('2 min ago', 'Just now')."
  ac6_manual_sync_button:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "'Sync Now' button in popover calls syncNow() which triggers immediate performCommitAndPush() after clearing any pending debounce timeout."
  ac7_conflict_resolution_ui:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "GitConflictDialog.tsx with full workflow: navigation between multiple conflicts, progress dots, resolution actions. Opens automatically when state.status === 'conflict'."
  ac8_diff_view:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Side-by-side comparison in GitConflictDialog showing localContent vs remoteContent. DiffHighlights component shows added/removed/modified line counts."
  ac9_resolution_options:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Three buttons: 'Keep Local' (git checkout --ours), 'Keep Remote' (git checkout --theirs), 'Merge Manually' (textarea editor). resolveConflict() handles all three."
  ac10_sync_history:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "SyncHistoryModal.tsx displays syncLog array from gitSyncService. Grouped by date, shows operation type, status badge, message, commit hash. Max 50 entries."
  ac11_server_auth:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Git operations run server-side using simple-git with system credentials. SSH and HTTPS supported via server environment. No credentials exposed to client."
  ac12_retry_backoff:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "pushWithRetry() implements exponential backoff: baseRetryDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount - 1). Delays: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s. maxRetries = 5. Non-retryable errors detected."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Git credentials never sent to client. All Git operations server-side. SSE uses same-origin policy. No sensitive data in sync logs."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "30s debounce prevents excessive commits. SSE is lightweight compared to WebSocket. Sync log capped at 50 entries. Exponential backoff prevents server hammering."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Auto-pull before push handles concurrent edits. Retry logic with backoff. Graceful handling of no-remote scenario. Connection drop recovery for SSE."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation: GitSyncService (server), useGitSync (client hook), UI components. TypeScript interfaces well-defined. Singleton pattern for service."
  usability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear status indicators with color coding. Relative timestamps. Pending changes count. One-click manual sync. Intuitive conflict resolution with diff view."
  accessibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Status badges have aria labels. Modal dialogs use proper ARIA attributes. Color is not sole indicator (icons accompany status). Keyboard navigation maintained."
