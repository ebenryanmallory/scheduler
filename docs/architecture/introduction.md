# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the Scheduler App, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
Since this project has a significant user interface, this document focuses on the core system architecture, data flow, and backend services. Frontend-specific details (component hierarchy, state management patterns) will be detailed in the Frontend Architecture Document/Specification, but the core technology stack choices documented herein are definitive for the entire project.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

This is an existing project ("Brownfield") that is being enhanced.
- **Current Stack**: React + Vite (Frontend), Express (Backend), TypeScript (Both)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui
- **Data Persistence**: Markdown files with Git sync + JSON for schedule
